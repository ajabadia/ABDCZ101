This is the 100 original patches for the CZ-230S converted for use
on the CZ-101,1000,3000,5000. (Can be dumped to CZ-1 also "E-1 to
F-8".)
These patched may be of interest if you ever wondered what Casio
used as the 100 presets on the CZ-230S, or if you wanted to copy 
these patches to your CZ-101,1000,3000,5000, or even to the CZ-1.
There are 6 banks of .syx files with 16 patches, and the last bank 
has only the 4 original presets in the CZ-230S user bank (96-99).
