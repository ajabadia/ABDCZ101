Ok, if any of you have a CZ seires synth from Casio, and are pulling your
hair out trying to find a Roland TB-303, I have created a 303-like sound
with the CZ.  Here's the parameters.  It's a good bassy, acid sound and I
have used it in a few of my tracks.  Enjoy.

Line Select: 2   Modulation: None

Detune: Negative, Octave: 1, Note: 00, Fine: 60

Vibrato: Wave: 4, Delay: 00, Rate: 00, Depth: 99

Octave: -1

DCO1:  Waveform: First 8, Second 5
       Step 1: rate 60, Level 66, SUS
       Step 2: rate 0, Level 0
       Step 3: rate 0, level 0 END

DCW1:  Key Follow 9
       Step 1: rate 99, Level 70 SUS
       Steps 2-7: Rate 50, Level 0
       Step 8: Rate 50, Level 0 END

DCA1:  Key Follow 0
       Step 1: Rate 99, Level 99
       All other steps same as DCW1

DCO2:  Waveform: First 5, Second 8
       Step 1: rate 60, Level 66 SUS
       Step 2: rate 50, Level 0 END

DCW2:  Key Follow 5
       Step 1: Rate 99, Level 99
       Step 2: rate 40, level 0
       Step 3: rate 0, level 0 END

DCA2:  Key Follow 5
       Step 1: Rate 99, Level 99 SUS
       Step 2: rate 50, level 0 END


Hope this is useful to somebody :)  I have about 8 or 9 other patches that
I have created, but have not logged them down on paper yet, so if anyone
wants them, Please E-Mail me directly, and I'll transcribe the whole mess.

Enjoy.
