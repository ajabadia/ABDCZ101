Coffeeshopped CZ Pack 1
=======================

Thanks for purchasing this set of sounds for your CZ synthesizer! Loading these sounds on to your synthesizer can be done with any program that transmits sysex files.

Simply load the .syx file for the sound you want into your sysex program, and transmit the MIDI data to your CZ. The sound will be loaded in the editing buffer of your synthesizer. This means it is not saved to your synth, but simply loaded as the currently playable sound. You can then use the buttons on your synth if you want to save the sound to an internal memory slot.

If you have any questions, please get in touch here: https://coffeeshopped.com/contact
