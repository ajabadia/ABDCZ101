This tip makes the CZ101 SO MUCH easier to use with a computer - if you are 
supporting it at all still, CZ nuts may find it helpful.  The tip is :
At least in later software revs, YOU CAN IGNORE HANDSHAKING and the CZ will 
still send and receive data.

Send it F0 44 00 00 70 10 70 31 F7 (note the handshaking is buried in the 
message)
It sends F0 44 00 00 70 30 <data> F7

If the CZ is not on ch 1, the correct channel must be in BOTH 7x's

Change the 0x30 in the data header to 0x20 <patch>, send it to the CZ, and it 
goes into the patch location.  Patch 0x60 is the edit buffer, 0x20..2F is 
internal memory, 0x40..4F is cartridge memory.

This has worked for me for 4 different CZs, and a bunch of computer hardware 
and software, including the venerable MIDIEX.  The only problem is that a 
data dump from the CZ is not the same format as a data dump to the CZ, and 
editing binary files and changing their length is a hassle.
