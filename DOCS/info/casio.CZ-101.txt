S/H means, that a source (most the noise) is sampled (take one value) and
hold that value till the next trigger. To immitate this effect on the cz101
you have to take one value fast (e.g.DCF), thus '#1 t=0 L=xx(here 55), than
hold this value: #2 t=99 l=xx+1 (56), than take a new 'trigger' #3 t=0 l=yy
(78), than hold this value like shown above #4 t=99 l=yy+ (or-) 1 (77), than
jump again and so on... You see you can only use 3 phases/triggers but the
effect is superb, I immitate a little bit the Wavetable scanning (at these
times I didn't own a PPG :) ). The same you can do with the pitch.
Interesting is, if you take both osc and start the second after the first
s/h immitation! I think for short s/h effects is good enough. Also with
using the resonance waveforms it makes really funny, analogue sounds. 

With varying the times or the levels ranges, you can speed or slow this effect!

I see the guys running to their CZs and trying...I played my CZ over
Christmas too and I wonder myself what nice sounds in there.
